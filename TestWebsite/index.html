<h4 class= "intro"> Hi and Welcome to Virtual Eating</h4>

<p class= "bodyText">This site is made to recreate the original website, now take down, virtual eating hosted at freewebs.com in the early 2000's. It is being recreated very slowly but overal the goal is to recreate the games once created by 7th graders for 7th graders: A world where you ask your father for money, play wack-a-mole and eat virtual bananas.</p>
